        <p>Carrot halwa, or gajar ka halwa, is a traditional Indian dessert that's deliciously rich and creamy. This recipe uses whole milk, not condensed milk. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream for a real treat!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee or oil</li>

            <li>1 ½ quarts whole milk</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
            <p>Heat ghee in a large saucepan over medium heat and add carrots. Cook and stir briefly, about 3 minutes.

            <p>Bring carrot mixture back to a boil; add sugar, raisins, cardamom, and saffron. Cook and stir until mixture has thickened, about 10 minutes.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
            <p>Ladle carrot halwa into 8 individual serving dishes. Top each serving with 1 tablespoon pistachios. Serve warm or chill before serving.</p>
